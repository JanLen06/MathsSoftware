# MathsSoftware
A MathsSoftware which in the end shall be able to complete every task given to you by your teacher.

Since the calculators we use in school are able to run python scripts, I had the idea to write a program, which shall be able to do all necessary calculations no matter wheter it's 
functions, equations, probability calculation or something else.
I also plan to do a desktop version to be way more comfortable to use but at first I'm gonna concentrate on completing the "skeleton" and coding the main functionalities.
